By adopting modularity, software systems become more robust, adaptable, and easier to manage over their lifecycle.


Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version Control Systems (VCS) are tools that help software developers manage changes to source code over time. These systems keep track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.

Importance of Version Control Systems in Software Development:
Collaboration:

Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each otherâ€™s work. VCS manage and merge changes from different team members seamlessly.
Backup and Restore:

VCS act as a backup system. All changes are saved, allowing developers to restore previous versions of the codebase if something goes wrong.
Tracking Changes:

Every change is recorded, including who made the change, what was changed, and why it was changed. This history is invaluable for understanding the evolution of the codebase and for debugging.
Branching and Merging:

Developers can create branches to work on new features or bug fixes independently of the main codebase. Once the work is complete, these branches can be merged back into the main line of development.
Collaboration Across Geographies:

Teams distributed across different locations can collaborate effectively, with VCS synchronizing their changes.
Documentation:

VCS often include features to document changes through commit messages, which describe the intent and purpose of changes.
Examples of Popular Version Control Systems and Their Features:
Git:

Features:
Distributed VCS: Every developer has a full copy of the repository, including its history.
